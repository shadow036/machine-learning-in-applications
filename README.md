# Machine Learning in Applications Project

In this project, the capabilities of autoencoders on time-series anomaly detection (TAD) based on reconstruction cost will be studied with all its details.

Objectives:
* Implement an autoencoder model that has capacity to be able to generate same output with input. (Capacity: to have enough trainable parameters to handle reconstruction of time-series.)
* Demonstrate the importance of evaluation method selection in TAD. 
* Compare traditional training techniques by adversarial training with adversarial autoencoder. Same autoencoder will be used  to demonstrate regularization phase of adversarial learning better.
